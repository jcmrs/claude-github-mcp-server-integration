# Human Ideas & Considerations Backlog

## Purpose
Systematic capture of human ideas, questions, and considerations that occur after conversation time limits or between development sessions. This addresses the very human tendency to have insights and ideas after formal work sessions end.

## How to Use This File
1. **Add new ideas** using the template structure below
2. **Include context** about which conversation or phase the idea relates to
3. **Specify type** of enhancement or improvement
4. **Set priority** based on perceived impact
5. **Provide details** with full explanation of the concept

## Template for New Ideas

## Current Ideas Backlog

### Idea/Question: Command Chaining for Primary Commands
**Date Added:** 2025-08-28
**Context:** Setup Core v2 - Command system development
**Type:** Command enhancement
**Priority:** Medium
**Details:** Allow primary commands to be chained together (e.g., MILESTONE + SAVE) for logical workflow combinations. Would reduce human interaction overhead and create natural workflow patterns.
**Implementation Notes:** Need to consider token multiplication, message length limits, and error handling complexity.
**Status:** Under Consideration - Documented in FUTURE-CONCEPTS.md

### Idea/Question: Specialized Development Conversations
**Date Added:** 2025-08-28
**Context:** Setup Core v2 - Development command usage patterns
**Type:** Workflow optimization
**Priority:** High
**Details:** Create specialized conversation types for development commands (UPDATE-INDEX, PROJECT-STATE, etc.) to improve token efficiency and separate maintenance operations from development work.
**Implementation Notes:** Simple implementation: single "Development Maintenance" conversation. Advanced: multiple specialized conversation types.
**Status:** Under Consideration - Simple version to be implemented

### Idea/Question: READ Command for Historical Context Access
**Date Added:** 2025-08-28
**Context:** Setup Core v2 - Need for systematic transcript access
**Type:** New feature
**Priority:** High
**Details:** Implement READ command to systematically access specific conversation transcripts and project files with human-friendly naming (e.g., READ Setup-Core-v1).
**Implementation Notes:** Use existing GitHub file access with conversation name mapping to file paths.
**Status:** Planned - Implementation in progress

### Idea/Question: Enhanced STATUS Command with Development Guidance
**Date Added:** 2025-08-28
**Context:** Setup Core v2 - Unclear when to use development commands
**Type:** Command enhancement
**Priority:** High
**Details:** STATUS command should provide specific recommendations for when to execute development commands (UPDATE-INDEX, PROJECT-STATE, etc.) based on conversation progress and repository state.
**Implementation Notes:** Add logic to STATUS that analyzes conversation progress and repository health to recommend specific actions.
**Status:** Planned - Implementation in progress

### Idea/Question: Repository for Post-Conversation Ideas
**Date Added:** 2025-08-28
**Context:** Setup Core v2 - 5-hour limit reached with remaining ideas
**Type:** System improvement
**Priority:** Medium
**Details:** Create systematic way to capture human ideas that occur after conversation limits. Very human tendency to have insights after formal work ends.
**Implementation Notes:** This file (HUMAN-IDEAS-BACKLOG.md) serves as the implementation.
**Status:** Implemented - This file is the solution

## Implemented Ideas

### Idea: Repository Maintenance System
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - Documentation drift concerns
**Implementation:** REPO-MAINTENANCE-CHECKLIST.md and REPO-CHECK command
**Result:** Systematic maintenance prevents documentation drift and missed updates
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28

### Idea: LLM Drift Management Documentation
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - Marketing language drift identified
**Implementation:** Documented in FUTURE-CONCEPTS.md with prevention strategies
**Result:** Awareness and prevention mechanisms for marketing language replacement of engineering reality
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28

### Idea: Large File Update Management
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - Continue button triggered by large README update
**Implementation:** Documented in FUTURE-CONCEPTS.md with file size monitoring protocols
**Result:** Proactive identification of potential workflow interruptions
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28
