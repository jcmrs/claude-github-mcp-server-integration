# Human Ideas & Considerations Backlog

## Purpose
Systematic capture of human ideas, questions, and considerations that occur after conversation time limits or between development sessions. This addresses the very human tendency to have insights and ideas after formal work sessions end.

## How to Use This File
1. **Add new ideas** using the template structure below
2. **Include context** about which conversation or phase the idea relates to
3. **Specify type** of enhancement or improvement
4. **Set priority** based on perceived impact
5. **Provide details** with full explanation of the concept

## Implemented Ideas

### Idea: LIST Command for Command Discoverability
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - Realization that users don't know what commands are available
**Implementation:** LIST command showing all available commands with status indicators and brief descriptions
**Result:** Immediate command discovery for new conversations, solving user onboarding challenge
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28

### Idea: HELP Command for Detailed Command Guidance
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - Need for detailed command help without reading full documentation
**Implementation:** HELP [command] providing context-specific guidance and usage examples
**Result:** Quick access to detailed command information and integration guidance
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28

### Idea: Dev Commands Specialized Conversation
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - Development command usage patterns consuming tokens in main conversations
**Implementation:** "Dev Commands v1" specialized conversation with complete starter text and workflow integration
**Result:** Token-efficient specialized maintenance operations with clear setup process
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28

### Idea: Enhanced STATUS Command with Development Guidance
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - Unclear when to use development commands
**Implementation:** STATUS command enhanced with specific recommendations for development commands and specialized conversation usage
**Result:** Intelligent workflow guidance reducing decision overhead for users
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28

### Idea: READ Command for Historical Context Access
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - Need for systematic transcript access
**Implementation:** READ command with human-friendly naming (READ Setup-Core-v1, READ project-state)
**Result:** Systematic access to historical conversation details and project files
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28

### Idea: Repository for Post-Conversation Ideas
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - 5-hour limit reached with remaining ideas
**Implementation:** HUMAN-IDEAS-BACKLOG.md with template structure and idea tracking
**Result:** Systematic capture of human insights occurring after formal work sessions
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28

### Idea: Command Chaining for Primary Commands
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - Command system development
**Implementation:** Documented in FUTURE-CONCEPTS.md with technical considerations and implementation roadmap
**Result:** Concept preserved for future implementation with technical challenges identified
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28 (documented for future implementation)

### Idea: Repository Maintenance System
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - Documentation drift concerns
**Implementation:** REPO-MAINTENANCE-CHECKLIST.md and REPO-CHECK command
**Result:** Systematic maintenance prevents documentation drift and missed updates
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28

### Idea: LLM Drift Management Documentation
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - Marketing language drift identified
**Implementation:** Documented in FUTURE-CONCEPTS.md with prevention strategies
**Result:** Awareness and prevention mechanisms for marketing language replacement of engineering reality
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28

### Idea: Large File Update Management
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - Continue button triggered by large README update
**Implementation:** Documented in FUTURE-CONCEPTS.md with file size monitoring protocols
**Result:** Proactive identification of potential workflow interruptions with empirical thresholds
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28

### Idea: Specialized Conversation Repository Status Tracking
**Original Context:** Setup Core v2 - Advanced specialized conversation management
**Implementation:** Advanced concept documented in FUTURE-CONCEPTS.md for future implementation
**Result:** Framework for sophisticated multi-specialized conversation coordination
**Date Implemented:** 2025-08-28 (advanced concept documented)
