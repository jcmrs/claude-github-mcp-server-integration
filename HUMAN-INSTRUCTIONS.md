## Specialized Conversation Setup

### Dev Commands Conversation - Simple Setup

**Recommended Name:** "Dev Commands v1" (simple, clear, versioned)

**When to Create:**
1. **Project Start Checklist** - Recommended as part of initial setup
2. **MILESTONE Prompts** - When development commands accumulate
3. **STATUS Recommendations** - When main conversation gets command-heavy

### Creating Dev Commands Conversation

**Step 1:** Create new conversation named "Dev Commands v1"

**Step 2:** Use this conversation starter text:
```
You are the Dev Commands specialist for the Claude.AI + GitHub project jcmrs/claude-github-mcp-server-integration.

ROLE: Execute development commands (UPDATE-INDEX, PROJECT-STATE, ISSUE-UPDATE, REPO-CHECK, HANDOFF-PREP) efficiently without consuming tokens from main development conversations.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read CONVERSATION-INDEX.json immediately
2. Read conversation-handoffs/project-state.json  
3. Review HUMAN-INSTRUCTIONS.md for command details
4. Execute commands as requested by human
5. Report completion status back

SCOPE: Development command execution, repository maintenance, project coordination updates.

CONVERSATION TYPE: Dev Commands v1
PURPOSE: Token-efficient specialized maintenance operations

Ready to execute development commands for the project.
```

**Step 3:** Confirm Claude understands its specialized role

### Integration with Main Conversations

**MILESTONE Auto-Prompt:**
```
üîß **DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS RECOMMENDATION**
Consider using "Dev Commands v1" conversation for:
‚Ä¢ UPDATE-INDEX (project priorities changed)  
‚Ä¢ PROJECT-STATE (major achievements to document)
‚Ä¢ ISSUE-UPDATE (progress on GitHub issues)

This keeps main conversation focused on development work.
```

**STATUS Command Enhancement:**
Now includes "Dev Commands conversation recommended" when appropriate.

## When Claude Will Auto-Signal for Commands

### Automatic Triggers
- **Message approaching 8,000 characters** - Claude signals efficiency warning ‚Üí Suggests `SAVE`
- **Token usage getting high** - Claude requests `STATUS` check
- **Major milestone completed** - Claude suggests `MILESTONE` command ‚Üí **Auto-triggers `REPO-CHECK`** ‚Üí **Recommends Dev Commands conversation**
- **Artifacts getting too large** - Claude recommends `ARTIFACT-REPO`
- **Natural handoff point reached** - Claude suggests `HANDOFF-PREP`
- **Issue progress significant** - Claude recommends `ISSUE-UPDATE` (via Dev Commands conversation)
- **Project state changed** - Claude suggests `PROJECT-STATE` (via Dev Commands conversation)
- **New concepts identified** - Claude auto-runs `REPO-CHECK` for documentation updates
- **Development commands accumulating** - Claude recommends "Dev Commands v1" conversation

### Claude Signal Format
When Claude needs action, it will use:
```
üö® **HUMAN ACTION NEEDED:** [Command] - [Reason]
üîß **DEV COMMANDS RECOMMENDED:** Use "Dev Commands v1" conversation for: [specific commands]
```

## Enhanced STATUS Command Output

### STATUS Command Now Provides
**Conversation Health:**
- Current message length and token usage
- Conversation efficiency assessment
- Context window utilization

**Repository Maintenance Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Healthy** - All files current, documentation complete

**Development Command Recommendations:**
- **UPDATE-INDEX recommended** when conversation priorities have shifted significantly
- **PROJECT-STATE recommended** when major progress achieved but not yet documented
- **ISSUE-UPDATE recommended** when substantial work completed on tracked issues
- **HANDOFF-PREP recommended** when conversation approaching natural ending point
- **ARTIFACT-REPO recommended** when large content created that should be in repository
- **REPO-CHECK recommended** when significant changes made since last maintenance

**Specialized Conversation Recommendations:**
- **"Dev Commands v1" recommended** when multiple development commands needed
- **Token efficiency suggestion** when main conversation getting command-heavy
- **Setup guidance** if Dev Commands conversation doesn't exist

**Next Action Suggestions:**
- Immediate priorities based on conversation progress

## Repository Maintenance Integration

### REPO-CHECK Command Details
**Purpose:** Systematic verification that repository files match conversation progress  
**Triggers:** Before MILESTONE, before SAVE, at handoff points, when significant changes occur  
**Process:** Claude runs through REPO-MAINTENANCE-CHECKLIST.md systematically  
**Output:** Reports what needs updating and executes necessary repository updates  

### Automatic Repository Maintenance

2. Need help with specific command: `HELP STATUS` for detailed guidance
3. Check system health: `STATUS` for comprehensive assessment
4. Access historical context: `READ Setup-Core-v1` for previous conversation

### Basic Workflow
1. Work on tasks normally
2. Use `STATUS` to check health and get development command recommendations
3. When Claude signals or STATUS recommends: Execute suggested commands
4. At completion points: `MILESTONE` (triggers repo maintenance + Dev Commands recommendations)
5. For important preservation: `SAVE`

### Enhanced Development Workflow  
1. Complete significant work: `STATUS` to check recommendations
2. If multiple dev commands needed: Create/use "Dev Commands v1" conversation
3. Execute recommended development commands in specialized conversation
4. Mark achievements in main conversation: `MILESTONE` 
5. Access historical context as needed: `READ [target]`
6. When ready to handoff: `HANDOFF-PREP` ‚Üí `SAVE`

### Specialized Conversation Pattern
1. Main conversation: Focus on development work
2. `STATUS` recommends development commands + specialized conversation
3. Create "Dev Commands v1" conversation with provided starter text
4. Execute: `UPDATE-INDEX`, `PROJECT-STATE`, `ISSUE-UPDATE`, `REPO-CHECK`
5. Return to main conversation with clean repository state

### Repository Maintenance Workflow
1. `STATUS` shows repository health and command recommendations
2. Execute recommended commands (main conversation or Dev Commands conversation)
3. `REPO-CHECK` verifies all updates complete
4. `MILESTONE` to mark maintenance completion
5. `SAVE` to preserve maintenance work

### Cross-Conversation Reference Workflow
1. `READ Setup-Core-v1` to access previous conversation details
2. `READ project-state` to understand current status
3. `READ issue-5` to review specific issue context
4. Continue work with complete historical context
5. `UPDATE-INDEX` to reflect cross-conversation insights
