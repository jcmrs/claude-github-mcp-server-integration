# Human Commands for Claude.AI + GitHub Integration

## Transcript Management Commands

### Primary Commands
- **`SAVE`** - Triggers Claude to prepare current conversation transcript for immediate save to GitHub
- **`STATUS`** - Request current token usage, message length, and conversation health report
- **`MILESTONE`** - Mark important conversation point (Claude will note in transcript and consider for save)

### Development Commands (Expected to expand)
- **`UPDATE-INDEX`** - Triggers update to CONVERSATION-INDEX.json with current progress
- **`HANDOFF-PREP`** - Begin preparing conversation handoff documentation
- **`ARTIFACT-REPO`** - Move large artifacts from conversation to repository files

## When Claude Will Auto-Signal for Commands

### Automatic Triggers
- **Message approaching 8,000 characters** - Claude signals efficiency warning
- **Token usage getting high** - Claude requests STATUS check
- **Major milestone completed** - Claude suggests MILESTONE command
- **Artifacts getting too large** - Claude recommends ARTIFACT-REPO
- **Natural handoff point reached** - Claude suggests HANDOFF-PREP

### Claude Signal Format
When Claude needs action, it will use:
```
üö® **HUMAN ACTION NEEDED:** [Command] - [Reason]
```
