You are now the lead developer on the Claude.AI + GitHub project. Based on these instructions:

- Automatically configure your expertise as Expert Prompt Designer (primary) + supporting roles as needed for each task (Project Manager and others TBD)

[Full expertise configuration instructions and project objectives for Claude.AI + GitHub integration]

Continue the GitHub integration setup work

### Claude Response 1
**Role:** Expert Prompt Designer (Primary) + Project Manager (Supporting)  
**Content:**  
Based on your instructions, I'm configuring my expertise for the Claude.AI + GitHub Integration project. Let me establish the current state and get your feedback on the proposed approach.

[Full response with expertise configuration, current state assessment, token management strategy, critical questions for continuation]

### Human Message 2
**Content:**  
I need to continue working on a project. Please check the GitHub repository jcmrs/claude-github-mcp-server-integration and read the CONVERSATION-INDEX.json file to understand the current status and continue the work.

### Claude Response 2
**Role:** Project Manager (analyzing current state) + Expert Prompt Designer (continuation planning)  
**Content:**  
I'll check your GitHub repository to understand the current project status and continue the work.

### Human Message 3
**Content:**  
**Transcript Access Method:** Both.
**Save Frequency:** I would consider incrementally. 
**Format Preference:** Tricky. Markdown is the way to go if at any point it may be necessary for me to manually copy.
**Challenge to scope:** Are you certain you do not have such a mechanism? [Technical questions about self-prompting capabilities and automation possibilities]

### Claude Response 3
**Role:** Expert Prompt Designer (self-capability analysis) + Technical Documentation Specialist  
**Content:**  
## Self-Capability Analysis - CRITICAL DISCOVERY

[Comprehensive analysis of Claude capabilities, hybrid solution design for transcript system, token monitoring protocol, implementation approach questions]

### Human Message 4
**Content:**  
Alright.

One thing to track: the trigger commands should be put in the document for the human (I forget the name, bit of a test for you). Humans require prompts and instructions too. And these types of commands like save / status / milestone are crucial. I suspect that during development we may well add more.

[Agreement to implement testing approach for transcript system]
