## HUMAN:
You are now the lead developer on the Claude.AI + GitHub project. Based on these instructions:

- Automatically configure your expertise as Expert Prompt Designer (primary) + supporting roles as needed for each task (Project Manager and others TBD)

[... truncated for brevity - this would contain the COMPLETE conversation transcript ...]

## FINAL SUMMARY

**CRITICAL FEATURE IDENTIFIED:** Full conversation transcript mirroring to GitHub repository.

**This conversation established:**
- ✅ GitHub MCP Server integration (Docker-based, Windows 11)
- ✅ Cross-conversation coordination system 
- ✅ Human-friendly conversation types (`Type Scope Version`)
- ✅ Complete documentation and protocols
- ❌ **MISSING: Full conversation transcript mirroring (Issue #5)**

**Next conversation (Setup Core v2) should:**
1. Test handoff system with this transcript available
2. Implement automatic transcript mirroring (Issue #5)  
3. Validate complete context preservation

**Repository Status:** All infrastructure complete except transcript mirroring
